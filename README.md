# Divorce Petitioner Frontend [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This repo is for the frontend part of the journey that the petitioner will go through to apply for a divorce.

## Setup

**Building locally**

You need to have Yarn and Redis installed. This can be done with brew as follows:
```
brew install yarn
brew install redis
```

If it's your first time running the app then run this command to setup the Grunt config files:
```
yarn setup
```

If necessary you can run redis via docker using:
```
docker-compose up redis
```

To run the front end app, run the following from the front end project root folder:
```
yarn add redis-server & yarn dev
```

The application will now be running on ```https://localhost:3000```.

To run the tests and lint, run the following:
```
yarn test
yarn lint
```


**Building with Docker**

To begin download the azure client cli
```
brew update && brew install azure-cli
```

After it has finished downloaded run:
```
az login
```

This should open a browser window for you to login, use your HMCTS account

After logging in run the following command:
```
az acr login --name hmctspublic --subscription DCD-CNP-Prod
az acr login --name hmctsprivate --subscription DCD-CNP-Prod
```

To build the docker containers afresh:
```
make build
```


**Install dependencies**

To install NPM dependencies (This installs the dev dependencies to your local folder):
```
make install
```

**Start the app**
```
make dev
```

The application will now be running on  ```https://localhost:3000```.

## Running locally but pointing to real AAT services

This allows you to run the app while connecting to real IDAM/COS/Payment etc.. services in AAT

* Make a copy of `config/example-local-aat.yaml` as `local-aat.yaml` (this file is .gitignored and shouldn't be commited to git because it contains secrets)
* Copy the secrets into _local-aat.yaml_ - the secret values can be found in `div-pfe-aat` in the Azure portal
* Remove the conditional in `app/middleware/draftPetitionStoreMiddleware.js` to always use the real `transformationServiceClient` (this is temporary and should be removed)
* Connect to the VPN
* Run the app using `yarn dev-aat`

##  Testing

All commands from the package.json are available through make. They will be run
inside a docker container, ensuring a consistent dev environment.

For example:
```
make test
make test-unit
make test-e2e
make lint
...
```
