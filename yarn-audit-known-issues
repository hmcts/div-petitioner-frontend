      "overview": "### Impact\nUsers of typed-rest-client library version 1.7.3 or lower are vulnerable to leak authentication data to 3rd parties. \n\nThe flow of the vulnerability is as follows:\n\n1. Send any request with `BasicCredentialHandler`, `BearerCredentialHandler` or `PersonalAccessTokenCredentialHandler` \n2. The target host may return a redirection (3xx), with a link to a second host.\n3. The next request will use the credentials to authenticate with the second host, by setting the `Authorization` header.\n\nThe expected behavior is that the next request will *NOT* set the `Authorization` header.\n\n\n### Patches\nThe problem was fixed on April 1st 2020.\n\n\n### Workarounds\nThere is no workaround.\n\n### References\nThis is similar to the following issues in nature:\n1. [HTTP authentication leak in redirects](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/CVE-2018-1000007.html) - I used the same solution as CURL did.\n2.
