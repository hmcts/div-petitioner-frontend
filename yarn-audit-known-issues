However, polluting the prototype of a single object can have significant security impact for an application if the object is later used in trusted operations.\n\n## Impact\nThis vulnerability could allow an attacker to set arbitrary and unexpected keys on the object returned from `JSON5.parse`. The actual impact will depend on how applications utilize the returned object and how they filter unwanted keys, but could include denial of service, cross-site scripting, elevation of privilege, and in extreme cases, remote code execution.\n\n## Mitigation\nThis vulnerability is patched in json5 v2.2.2 and later. A patch has also been backported for json5 v1 in versions v1.0.2 and later.\n\n## Details\n \nSuppose a developer wants to allow users and admins to perform some risky operation, but they want to restrict what non-admins can do. To accomplish this, they accept a JSON blob from the user, parse it using `JSON5.parse`, confirm that the provided data does not set some sensitive keys, and then performs the risky operation using the validated data:\n \n```js\nconst JSON5 = require('json5');\n\nconst doSomethingDangerous = (props) => {\n  if (props.isAdmin) {\n    console.log('Doing dangerous thing as admin.');\n  } else {\n    console.log('Doing dangerous thing as user.');\n  }\n};\n\nconst secCheckKeysSet = (obj, searchKeys) => {\n  let searchKeyFound = false;\n  Object.keys(obj).forEach((key) => {\n    if (searchKeys.indexOf(key) > -1) {\n      searchKeyFound = true;\n    }\n  });\n  return searchKeyFound;\n};\n\nconst props = JSON5.parse('{\"foo\": \"bar\"}');\nif (!secCheckKeysSet(props, ['isAdmin', 'isMod'])) {\n  doSomethingDangerous(props); // \"Doing dangerous thing as user.\"\n} else {\n  throw new Error('Forbidden...');\n}\n```\n \nIf the user attempts to set the `isAdmin` key, their request will be rejected:\n \n```js\nconst props = JSON5.parse('{\"foo\": \"bar\", \"isAdmin\": true}');\nif (!secCheckKeysSet(props, ['isAdmin', 'isMod'])) {\n  doSomethingDangerous(props);\n} else {\n  throw new Error('Forbidden...'); // Error: Forbidden...\n}\n```\n \nHowever, users can instead set the `__proto__` key to `{\"isAdmin\": true}`. `JSON5` will parse this key and will set the `isAdmin` key on the prototype of the returned object, allowing the user to bypass the security check and run their request as an admin:\n \n```js\nconst props = JSON5.parse('{\"foo\": \"bar\", \"__proto__\": {\"isAdmin\": true}}');\nif (!secCheckKeysSet(props, ['isAdmin', 'isMod'])) {\n  doSomethingDangerous(props); // \"Doing dangerous thing as admin.\"\n} else {\n  throw new Error('Forbidden...');\n}\n ```","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9c47-m6qq-7p4h"},"1096570":{"findings":[{"version":"1.1.8","paths":["webpack-dev-server>ip","superagent-proxy>proxy-agent>socks-proxy-agent>socks>ip","sass-loader>node-sass>make-fetch-happen>socks-proxy-agent>socks>ip","sass-loader>node-sass>node-gyp>make-fetch-happen>socks-proxy-agent>socks>ip","webpack-dev-server>chokidar>fsevents>node-gyp>make-fetch-happen>socks-proxy-agent>socks>ip","express-nunjucks>nunjucks-async-loader>chokidar>fsevents>node-gyp>make-fetch-happen>socks-proxy-agent>socks>ip","extract-text-webpack-plugin>webpack>watchpack>chokidar>fsevents>node-gyp>make-fetch-happen>socks-proxy-agent>socks>ip","string-replace-webpack-plugin>file-loader>webpack>watchpack>chokidar>fsevents>node-gyp>make-fetch-happen>socks-proxy-agent>socks>ip","string-replace-webpack-plugin>file-loader>webpack>watchpack>watchpack-chokidar2>chokidar>fsevents>node-gyp>make-fetch-happen>socks-proxy-agent>socks>ip","string-replace-webpack-plugin>file-loader>webpack>node-libs-browser>crypto-browserify>browserify-cipher>browserify-aes>evp_bytestokey>node-gyp>make-fetch-happen>socks-proxy-agent>socks>ip","string-replace-webpack-plugin>file-loader>webpack>node-libs-browser>crypto-browserify>browserify-sign>parse-asn1>browserify-aes>evp_bytestokey>node-gyp>make-fetch-happen>socks-proxy-agent>socks>ip"]}],"metadata":null,"vulnerable_versions":"<1.1.9","module_name":"ip","severity":"moderate","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-78xj-cgh5-2h22","cves":["CVE-2023-42282"],"access":"public","patched_versions":">=1.1.9","cvss":{"score":0,"vectorString":null},"updated":"2024-02-20T18:30:41.000Z","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 1.1.9 or later","cwe":["CWE-918"],"found_by":null,"deleted":null,"id":1096570,"references":"- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-42282\n- https://cosmosofcyberspace.github.io/npm_ip_cve/npm_ip_cve.html\n- https://github.com/JoshGlazebrook/socks/issues/93#issue-2128357447\n- https://github.com/github/advisory-database/pull/3504#issuecomment-1937179999\n- https://github.com/indutny/node-ip/pull/138\n- https://github.com/indutny/node-ip/commit/32f468f1245574785ec080705737a579be1223aa\n- https://github.com/indutny/node-ip/commit/6a3ada9b471b09d5f0f5be264911ab564bf67894\n- https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-78xj-cgh5-2h22","created":"2024-02-08T18:30:39.000Z","reported_by":null,"title":"NPM IP package incorrectly identifies some private IP addresses as public","npm_advisory_id":null,"overview":"The `isPublic()` function in the NPM package `ip` doesn't correctly identify certain private IP addresses in uncommon formats such as `0x7F.1` as private.

It is possible to access any file on the developer's machine._\n\n### Details\nThe middleware can either work with the physical filesystem when reading the files or it can use a virtualized in-memory _memfs_ filesystem.\nIf _writeToDisk_ configuration option is set to **true**, the physical filesystem is used:\n[https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/blob/7ed24e0b9f53ad1562343f9f517f0f0ad2a70377/src/utils/setupOutputFileSystem.js#L21](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/blob/7ed24e0b9f53ad1562343f9f517f0f0ad2a70377/src/utils/setupOutputFileSystem.js#L21)\n\nThe _**getFilenameFromUrl**_ method is used to parse URL and build the local file path.\nThe public path prefix is stripped from the URL, and the **unsecaped** path suffix is appended to the _outputPath_:\n[https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/blob/7ed24e0b9f53ad1562343f9f517f0f0ad2a70377/src/utils/getFilenameFromUrl.js#L82](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/blob/7ed24e0b9f53ad1562343f9f517f0f0ad2a70377/src/utils/getFilenameFromUrl.js#L82)\nAs the URL is not unescaped and normalized automatically before calling the midlleware, it is possible to use _%2e_ and _%2f_ sequences to perform path traversal attack.\n\n### PoC\n_A blank project can be created containing the following configuration file **webpack.config.js**:_\n`module.exports = {\n  devServer: {\n    devMiddleware: {\n      writeToDisk: true\n    }\n  }\n};\n`\n\nWhen started, it is possible to access any local file, e.g. _/etc/passwd_:\n`$ curl localhost:8080/public/..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f../etc/passwd`\n```\nroot:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash\ndaemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin\nbin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin\nsys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/usr/sbin/nologin\nsync:x:4:65534:sync:/bin:/bin/sync\ngames:x:5:60:games:/usr/games:/usr/sbin/nologin\n```\n\n### Impact\nThe developers using _webpack-dev-server_ or _webpack-dev-middleware_ are affected by the issue. When the project is started, an attacker might access any file on the developer's machine and exfiltrate the content (e.g. password, configuration files, private source code, ...).\n\nIf the development server is listening on a public IP address (or **0.0.0.0**), an attacker on the local network can access the local files without any interaction from the victim (direct connection to the port).\n\nIf the server allows access from third-party domains (CORS, **_Allow-Access-Origin: *_** ), an attacker can send a malicious link to the victim. When visited, the client side script can connect to the local server and exfiltrate the local files.\n\n### Recommendation\nThe URL should be unescaped and normalized before any further processing.","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wr3j-pwj9-hqq6"},"1096820":{"findings":[{"version":"4.18.2","paths":["express","webpack-dev-server>express"]}],"metadata":null,"vulnerable_versions":"<4.19.2","module_name":"express","severity":"moderate","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-rv95-896h-c2vc","cves":["CVE-2024-29041"],"access":"public","patched_versions":">=4.19.2","cvss":{"score":6.1,"vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"},"updated":"2024-03-27T21:47:29.000Z","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 4.19.2 or later","cwe":["CWE-601","CWE-1286"],"found_by":null,"deleted":null,"id":1096820,"references":"- https://github.com/expressjs/express/security/advisories/GHSA-rv95-896h-c2vc\n- https://github.com/koajs/koa/issues/1800\n- https://github.com/expressjs/express/pull/5539\n- https://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0867302ddbde0e9463d0564fea5861feb708c2dd\n- https://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0b746953c4bd8e377123527db11f9cd866e39f94\n- https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.location\n- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29041\n- https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rv95-896h-c2vc","created":"2024-03-25T19:40:26.000Z","reported_by":null,"title":"Express.js Open Redirect in malformed URLs","npm_advisory_id":null,"overview":"### Impact\n\nVersions of Express.js prior to 4.19.2 and pre-release alpha and beta versions before 5.0.0-beta.3 are affected by an open redirect vulnerability using malformed URLs.\n\nWhen a user of Express performs a redirect using a user-provided URL Express performs an encode [using `encodeurl`](https://github.com/pillarjs/encodeurl) on the contents before passing it to the `location` header. This can cause malformed URLs to be evaluated in unexpected ways by common redirect allow list implementations in Express applications, leading to an Open Redirect via bypass of a properly implemented allow list.\n\nThe main method impacted is `res.location()` but this is also called from within `res.redirect()`.\n\n### Patches\n\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0867302ddbde0e9463d0564fea5861feb708c2dd\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0b746953c4bd8e377123527db11f9cd866e39f94\n\nAn initial fix went out with `express@4.19.0`, we then patched a feature regression in `4.19.1` and added improved handling for the bypass in `4.19.2`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe fix for this involves pre-parsing the url string with either `require('node:url').parse` or `new URL`. These are steps you can take on your own before passing the user input string to `res.location` or `res.redirect`.\n\n###
